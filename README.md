# Shared Touch Portrait
## Experimental Live Performance done at Gray Area Artist Salon 2023

This was an experiment in audience creation of audiovisual content. The touch of a screen or click of a mouse on a client adapter creates a corresponding sound on the bigger canvas, along with sounds. 
It was an attempt to create a shared space of touch and co-creation in the post covid era.
